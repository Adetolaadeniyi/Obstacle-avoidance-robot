# Obstacle-avoidance-robot
This repository contains the circuit design, Arduino source code, and simulation files used to implement and test the obstacle avoidance robotic system.
The robot uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to nearby objects and adjusts its movement to avoid collisions in real time.

## Features
- Autonomous obstacle detection using an ultrasonic sensor
- Motor control using the L293D motor driver
- Real-time decision-making based on distance measurements
- Hardware design, simulation, and firmware implementation


## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04)
- L293D motor driver
- DC Gear motors
- NimH AA Battery

## Tools & Software
- Arduino IDE
- KiCad (schematic and PCB design)
- Proteus (circuit simulation)
- Tinkercad (virtual prototyping)

## How to Use
1. Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.
2. View and test the circuit behavior using Proteus or Tinkercad simulations.
3. Open the KiCad files to inspect or modify the schematic and PCB layout.
